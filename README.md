# Brain Tumor Classification with Data Augmentation

## Overview

This project investigates the effect of various data augmentation methods on classifying MRI images of brain tumors. The aim is to enhance the dataset and determine how different augmentation techniques impact model performance and generalization.

## Dataset
The [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) contains about 3000 MRI images of different types of brain tumors: meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors, as well as images with no tumors.

## Data Augmentation
To address the limited size of the dataset, various data augmentation techniques are applied:
1. **Basic Methods**: Rotation, horizontal and vertical shift, zoom, shear, brightness adjustment, and horizontal flip.
2. **Deformable Methods**: Random displacement using elastic deformation.
3. **Advanced Methods**: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating new MRI images.

## Results
- The original dataset achieves an overall accuracy of 91%.
- Applying basic augmentation techniques results in an accuracy drop to 87%.
- Adding images generated with deformable methods raises the accuracy to 91%.
- Images generated by GANs are not added to the dataset due to quality concerns.

## Conclusion
Data augmentation techniques can help improve the generalization of models for medical image classification. However, the performance gain is not always significant, and the quality of augmented data is crucial.
